# Online Social Networks (OII)


This repository contains the code written for the course _Online Social Networks_ taken at the Oxford Internet Institute in partial fulfillment for of the MSc Social Data Science programme.

## Analysis & Dataset

For this analysis, I scraped data from GitHub by querying GitHubâ€™s REST API. From this, I constructed two different networks: First, a network of collaboration (Who collaborates with whom on a repository?) and second, a response network based on data from the issue tracker (Who answers whom how quickly?). 

## Notebooks

* `Scraping_issue_tracker_GitHub.ipynb` contains python code to scrape the issue tracker
* `Scraping_of_Contributors_to_repos.ipynb` contains python code to scrape a GitHub organisation

* `Network_of_Contributors.ipynb` contains python code to construct the network of contributors
* `Constructing_Issue_Tracker_Network.ipynb` contains python code to construct the network of respondense.
